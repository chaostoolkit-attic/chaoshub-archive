# Status of the Chaos Hub Project

This page does not replace the list of issues tracked in the project but
should offer a quick overview of the main axes of improvements, in no
particular order.

## General Status

Currently, the project is in early stages. It does run and can get you some
way but is not be production ready yet. It is meant to be used as-is for
exploring its use case and send the project your feedback on its missing bits.

## Features Matrix

* Complete the local launcher of Chaos Toolkit instances [WIP]
  Currently, the local launcher buil into the Chaos Hub is working but is
  rough around the edges. It needs to be more battle tested.
* Implement the CRON launcher [TODO]
  The CRON launcher is not yet implemented properly and cannot be used at this
  stage.
* Finish the execution view [WIP]
  The view of your past executions is not completed yet and will likely break
  to render properly.
* Improve the past scheduling view [TODO]
* Write end-user documentationÂ [TODO]

## Code Status

The current status of the code is an honorable "meh". This means that we had
to take a few shortcuts in keeping it elegant and well tested.

* Re-work the unit tests [WIP]
* Cleanup the Vue.js templates [TODO]
* Fix docstrings [TODO]
* Write contributor guidelines [TODO]
