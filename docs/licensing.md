# Licensing

The followings are our interpretation of the AGPLv3 terms but they cannot be
deemed legally representative. We are merely trying to convey how we intend
to use this license.

## Why a copyleft license?

The Chaos Hub project is under the [AGPLv3+][agpl] license. Unlike other 
projects such as the [Chaos Toolkit][chaostoolkit] which fall under a 
permissive license, the Chaos Hub uses a copyleft license.

[agpl]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html
[chaostoolkit]: https://chaostoolkit.org

For libraries, a permissive license does make more sense to us because their
goal is to be embedded as freely as much as possible. The Chaos Hub is an
application, it does not aim at being embedded into a program. We
obviously want anyone to freely enjoy the project, but to protect
the project's community effort, it feels like the AGPLv3+ is the most
appropriate license.

There is also the aspect of some of our dependencies which are copyleft
licenses that mean we had to choose at least something as free (or restrictive
depending how you see it).

## Contribution

The Chaos Hub project uses a simple [Developer Certificate of Origin][dco] for
ensuring contributors certify they are allowed to submit a change, and that
they understand the consequences of the license of the project. Basically, all
contributions will be released under the project's license as well.

But, as contributors, you still have the copyright of the changes themselves.
Should the project decide to switch to a different license (non-compatible),
you could deny using your changes. This is also why any contributions must
be clean in the project's history, so we can easily understand what the
impact is.

## Use

You may be worried that merely using the Chaos Hub would force you to release
your whole world under a compatible license. In effect, you can run the Chaos
Hub in your environment without sharing your changes as long as your instance
cannot be accessed from outside your own network. If you run the Chaos Hub
as a SaaS, you must make your code available under a compatible license.
