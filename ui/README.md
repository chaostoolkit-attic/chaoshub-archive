# ChaosHub Frontend

This repository contains the frontend project for the ChaosHub application.

## Requirements

This requires the following packages to be installed:

```console
$ sudo npm install poi
$ npm install
```

## Build

You can build the artefacts by running:

```console
$ npm run build

We copy those artefacts into the app directory so that it can serve the
html files but also, if ran locally, the static files.
